## 🏛️ Design Pattern

This project follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) design pattern. The MVVM pattern allows separate the development of the graphical user interface from the business logic or back-end logic (the data model). The view model of MVVM is responsible for exposing the data objects from the model in such a way that those objects are easily managed and presented.
